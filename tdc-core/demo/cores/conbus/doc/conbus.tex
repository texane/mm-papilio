\section{Specifications}
This core allows up to several masters to communicate with up to several slaves on a shared Wishbone bus.

It takes care of bus arbitration and remapping of the slave base addresses. It is very simple and does not take care of priorities. Scheduling occurs when a master releases the bus, and then the next master which requested the bus takes ownership.

It is based on \verb!wb_conbus! from OpenCores.

\section{Using the core}
All parameters and ports should be self-explanatory. No special care should be taken.
